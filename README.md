# Data Flares
Privacy through confusion.

Data Flares is all about data privacy, especially tracking on the web. We are developing a software solution for simulated consumer behavior to deflect behavioral analysis and its outcome. Not preventing the flow of data - but making it unusable. 

## The Grand Mission
We want to give people back the power over their own data by hiding it in simulation.

By this, we don't care how good they track or analyse. We simply give them an impossible data base to work with. This way, they might come to conclusions about you, but they will be wrong.

## The Project
The idea of Data Flares was born during a late-night discussion on a trip through Colombia. We came up with an interesting approach to data privacy, and a couple of months later and back in Germany, we decided to give it a try.

In contrary to common approaches (e.g. AdBlocker, Ghostery), our solution doesnâ€™t block tracking but blurs with additional data. That works not purely random, but with a controlled random simulation as close to the user side as possible.

An approach that hasnâ€™t been seen before.

The software is divided into two components

- a browser extension that executes planned actions in the browser without the user having to take action (PETER.js)
- an algorithm that generates simulated user behavior and converts it into commands that the runner can execute (HEINZ.js)

While PETER is installed in the user's browser, HEINZ is supposed to run on a server. This way, PETER can always get the latest instructions from HEINZ and benefit from new developments without the user having to update.

Roadmap:

- Build PETER.
- Build HEINZ.
- Make HEINZ good.
