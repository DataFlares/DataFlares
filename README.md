### Data Flares

Privacy through confusion.

Data Flares is all about data privacy, especially tracking on the web. We are developing a software solution for simulated consumer behavior to deflect behavioral analysis and its outcome. Not preventing the flow of data - but making it unusable. 

## The Grand Mission

We want to give people back the power over their own data by hiding it in simulation.

## The Project

Ideas
how does it work
roadmap

We found our niche as a solution that doesnâ€™t block tracking but blurs with additional data. That works not purely random, but with a controlled random simulation. An approach that hasnâ€™t been seen before.
