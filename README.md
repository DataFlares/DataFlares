# Data Flares
Privacy through confusion.

Data Flares is all about data privacy, especially tracking on the web. We are developing a software solution for simulated consumer behavior to deflect behavioral analysis and its outcome. Not preventing the flow of data - but making it unusable. 

## The Grand Mission
We want to give people back the power over their own data by hiding it in simulation.

Data tracking and data analysis have become indispensable in today's world, especially on the internet. From websites visited, search bar entries, ad clicks to mouse behavior, almost everything can be tracked and traced. Collecting and analyzing data on individual and meta levels have become very powerful tools. They can be used for many good and useful ideas, such as making a website more appealing or better tailoring a new product to customer needs. Unfortunately, the tools can also be used for many negative or even dangerous purposes such as surveillance, manipulation, influence and other misuse of data. Examples of the wide-ranging possibilities that one can achieve and newspaper articles of well-known scandals can be googled within a few minutes.

The problem: as an individual internet user you have no choice. You are more or less forced to give away your data and surrender to data tracking. You can't accept or decline, your data is collected. To prevent tracking is difficult if not impossible. Because new and smart tracking blockers are followed by newer and smarter trackers and so it ends up in a perpetual game of cat and mouse. 

This is exactly where our philosophy comes in. Instead of preventing tracking, we allow tracking but make it useless by generating fake online surfing behavior. We put a costume on the internet user and create a new fake personality around his real online surfing behavior. By this, we don't care how good they track or analyze. We simply give them a sound looking but untrue data base to work with. This way, they might come to conclusions about you, but they will be wrong.

Now privacy can be restored while surfing and the user has the chance to decide by him- or herself if he or she wants to be tracked or not. 

## The Project
The idea of Data Flares was born during a late-night discussion on a trip through Colombia. We came up with an interesting approach to data privacy, and a couple of months later and back in Germany, we decided to give it a try.

In contrary to common approaches (e.g. AdBlocker, Ghostery), our solution doesn’t block tracking but blurs with additional data. That works not purely random, but with a controlled random simulation as close to the user side as possible.

An approach that hasn’t been seen before.

The software is divided into two components

- a browser extension that executes planned actions in the browser without the user having to take action (JAMES.js)
- an algorithm that generates simulated user behavior and converts it into commands that the runner can execute (SOPHIE.js)

While JAMES is installed in the user's browser, SOPHIE is supposed to run on a server. This way, JAMES can always get the latest instructions from SOPHIE and benefit from new developments without the user having to update.

Roadmap:

- Build JAMES.
- Build SOPHIE.
- Make SOPHIE good.

## Contributing 

First of all, this is our first open-source project so a lot of things are still a bit new for us. That also accounts to our developing abilities. Any idea, improvement, feedback or comment regarding the code, this repository and the management of it is really helpful to us!

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
